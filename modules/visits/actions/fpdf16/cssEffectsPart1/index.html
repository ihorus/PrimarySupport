 and animated without using any images or plug-ins.

<!-- The 'ontouchstart' event handler here causes Touch Events on the iPhone/iPad to
     trigger :hover effects on our elements.  This works, but is not ideal.  Instead,
     try to avoid requiring :hover functionality for basic interactions, as that concept
     does not exist in the touch world. -->

        <h1>CSS Site of Awesomeness</h1>
        <p>This site was created to showcase the power of CSS. No images or plug-ins were harmed during the creation of this page. The badge you see on the left, the glossy buttons above, and the sticky note on the right were all built using pure CSS. Check out the CSS animations in the menus&mdash; no plug-ins and minimal JavaScript!</p>
        <p>The advantages of using CSS properties for styling and animating your site are many, including smaller files (thus faster &amp; less bandwidth), iPad compatibility, more optimized execution, accessibility, and graceful degradation. </p>
        <p>Remember to check out the photo gallery demo from "CSS Effects, Part 2" session, where there are lots of cool 3D transforms and animation to tickle your senses!</p>
